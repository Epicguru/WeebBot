Weeb Bot

Got bored one afternoon so I made this bot for discord servers. All it does is post a reply to users when they type in the server chat channels, and replies with the 'mocking spongebob' meme where the meme caption is the text typed by the user.

The bot also has some added functionality such as setting a random chance of the reply happening, as well as a mode that will 'annoy' any one user, so that every single thing that they type will receive the meme regardless of random chance.

The bot can also be disabled and enabled.

 Feel free to add this bot to your servers - attribution to me would be nice but not required.
 In order to compile the bot, I recommend Visual Studio 2017 with .NET 4.7+.
 In the Program.cs file, there is a line that looks like:
     string token = "YouTokenHere";
     
 For the bot to work, replace "YourTokenHere" with a valid discord bot token, which can be made from the Discord Developer pannel.
 
 For step-by-step instructions on how to get this token, and install the bot on a server, see the first steps of:
